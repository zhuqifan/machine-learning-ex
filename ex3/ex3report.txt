in part 1,when i was training the dataset, i use nested loops to store the
conditional probability of each features given each label.
i named them feature result ,there are 57 features and each feature has 7 types.

so the parameter list i create for the first part is 57*7*3, because there
are 57 tables each has 7 types of value, which is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6,and three
labels 0 1 2

for testing, i use naive bayes formula to multiply each conditional probability
of each types of feature, and multiply the probability of each label.
then compare the probability of each labels of that sample, to check with the
valid label. Then calculate the accuracy.

for the second part, i store the mean of yes , mean of no, standard deviation
of yes, standard deviation of no, so i need to store 4 values for each of 57
features.
and i create a 2*2*57 table after the training.

for testing, i use the Gaussian models to calculate each conditional
probability for each feature, and multiply them together, then times the
probability of each label 0 and 1. Compare the probability of each label
and choose the highest one. compare to the valid label to calculate the accuracy.

for the last part, i pick 460 values in spambase.data for testing and use the
others for training. i do it 10 times and record the accuracy for each 461 test
samples. It is almost the same as the previous one.

the test result for part1 shows the accuracy is 0.865652
the test result for part2 shows the accuracy is 0.782826 for testing avc_c2
the test result for part2 shows the mean of accuracy is 0.815835 and the
standard deviation of accuracy is  0.149262 for testing spambase.data

in part1, the zero condition will decrease the value of accuracy, because in
naive bayes formula, when i multiply the conditional probability, one zero value
will cause the result to be zero, so in some case it will make the result to be
wrong.

in part2, the zero condition  has the same effect, the accuracy get higher
after i fixed.
